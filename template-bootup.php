        Every day starts the same, I go to howdareyou.io and run my Bootup process. With Bootup, the point is to replicate the consistency of how your computer boots up. Your computer's bootup process is down to a science, and if you have a good computer (ahem, Mac), you're computer should bootup without fail 99.99% of the time. Bootup was my answer to making my routine a science. It's easy to get sidetracked with your day, but as long as I follow my Bootup I know that I should have a productive, energetic, and meaningful day. My process is constantly evolving.

        <a href="#">My dream journal</a>. Every morning when I wake up, the first thing I do is open Evernote and try to put my dreams in writing. Sometimes it can be hard to remember your dreams at all, but I've found as long as you can remember a small portion of it you can remember more once you get writing. This journal is my gateway into my dreams. Sure, they seem nonsensical most of the time, but going back on old entries I can sometimes find profound meaning. Usually hinting to my subliminal intentions/fears. This is also a common technique to practicing lucid dreaming. If you learn to master this, it would make the future of VR look like child's play (I haven't had any luck mastering it yet).

        <a href="#">My NotToDo list</a>. More important than what you do, is sometimes what you don't do. That's why I've placed my NotToDo list before my ToDo list. For example, maybe you have the habit of taking phone calls before you get to your ToDo list, which sidetracks you. You can set a reminderâ€“ don't take any phone calls before Bootup is complete.

The story you tell about your life makes all the difference. Write a story that can have powerful transformation in yourself and tell it to yourself everyday. If you find yourself not believing it, it's time to reevaluate who you've become.

        I've found that limiting my Facebook time to 5 minutes in the morning makes sure that I don't miss anything important. The point is to skim my news feed as quickly as possible. This forces me to be very selective about the information I am ingesting. I'm usually looking for only information that is immediately applicable to my life, or perhaps useful in the very near future. If I see something that piques my interest, I open it in Safari for later reading/indexing.

        This is where I skim my email for 5 minutes to mark everything as read. Anything important but too long to skim in a matter of seconds is left for later, once my work day begins. I never reply to emails before my work day begins. If I have an irrelevant email, I immediately unsubscribe from it (It takes less than 30 seconds, and keeps digital noise to a min).

        I do my ToDo lists 1 of 2 ways. Some days I use the reminders app on my iPad, some days I do it with pen and a paper folder into quarters. I usually use the paper method when I'm editing/revising something. For example, I might look over a website I'm working on the night before, and write down all the things I want to fix/improve in list form.
